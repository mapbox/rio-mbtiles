Changes
=======

1.4.2 (2019-03-07)
------------------

- Missing support for RGBA input and output (PNG only) has been added (#26).
  Using the options --format PNG --rgba with rio-mbtiles will create RGBA PNG
  tiles from the first 4 bands of the input dataset.

1.4.1 (2018-10-17)
------------------

- Write out empty tiles at the lowest zoom levels when the reverse transform
  fails during our attempt to skip empty tiles entirely (#41).
- Avoid modifying rasterio windows in place as they have been made immutable
  in new versions of Rasterio (#43).

1.4.0 (2018-08-06)
------------------

- Empty tiles are skipped (#34).
- Require rasterio~=1.0 and the Rasterio's dataset overwriting option. Resolves
  issue #39.
- Rasterio's resampling options are enabled on the command line (#31).
- Require Python version >= 2.7.10. Mbtiles data will not be properly written
  with older versions of Python. See commit 57fba73 and
  https://bugs.python.org/issue23349.

1.3.0 (2016-10-05)
------------------

- Add --src-nodata and --dst-nodata options, with the same semantics as in
  rio-warp (#15).
- Require numpy>=1.10 and rasterio>=1.0a2

1.3a1 (2016-09-27)
------------------
- Require rasterio>=1.0a1

1.2.0 (2015-08-03)
------------------
- Register rio-mbtiles to rasterio.rio_plugins (#7).
- Use Rasterio's release-test-4 (0.25) wheels to speed up Travis builds (#11).

- 1.1.0 (2015-05-11)
------------------
- Rename module from rio_mbtiles to mbtiles (#2). Command remains the same.

1.0.1 (2015-05-09)
------------------
- Remove adaptive chunking and commit tiles as soon as possible to keep
  program memory well bounded.

1.0.0 (2015-05-08)
------------------
- Initial release. Exports version 1.1 MBTiles with automatic reprojection
  and parallel processing. Requires Rasterio >= 0.23.
